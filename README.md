# Sarcasm-Detection
<h2> <b>What is Sarcasm?</b> </h2>
Sarcasm is a statement or comment which means the opposite of what it says. It may be made with the intent of humor, or it may be made to be hurtful.

<h2><b>Sarcasm is not easy to comprehend</b></h2>

Actually, scientists are finding that the ability to detect sarcasm really is useful. 
Various studies conducted by psychologists and researchers, like “Would You Even Recognize Sarcasm?”, by John M. Grohol, suggest how even though sarcasm is used by people in all domains, it is always difficult to comprehend.
It’s no wonder why sarcasm is so often misused or misunderstood — half of us can’t recognize sarcasm in the first place. 
Further, the older generations have never been exposed to sarcasm for most part of their lives. In most cases, they end up assuming what said as true.

<h2><b>Use of Sarcasm in news headlines</b></h2>
As already discussed, we have experienced an increase in the number of news headlines that are sarcastic in tone
It has been noticed how many people, especially the previous generations misinterpret the sarcasm as truth and are left pondering about the same
Studies have shown that sarcastic headlines have more readers than the ones which directly convey the news
More and more articles thus have a sarcastic tone to pull more readers.
